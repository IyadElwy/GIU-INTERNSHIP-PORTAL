# The GIU Internship Portal

Hosted [here](https://aqueous-headland-97420.herokuapp.com/)

#### This document contains a small guide which gives you a general walkthrough as well as a more detailed one for each user. Below each user guide you will find the respective log-in information.

*The data found on the portal is only intended for demonstration purposes; those companies are not registered on the
portal*

### General walkthrough

At the top of the portal welcome-page you can find:

- Companies: All of the companies which are registered and may post jobs on the portal
- Jobs: The posted and approved jobs
- GIU Webpage: A quick shortcut to the official GIU webpage
- News: A news section which can be updated by the admin to inform students about important events etc.
- Help: A faq section to help answer some questions the students may have
- Log-in: Log in for all users
- Sign-up: Sign up for students

Beneath you can also find an example CV which can be created by a student using this portal

How it works:

1. A company registers and waits for approval from the faculty
2. The faculty approves or denies the company registration
3. If the company gets accepted it can post jobs for students to apply to
4. If a company posts a job it also has to be reviewed and accepted for students to be able to apply to it
5. A student can register and build out their profile
6. After that a student can apply for an internship
7. An application has to then be approved by the faculty before it can go through to the employers
8. If it gets accepted it will go through to the employer who can then accept the student for the internship
9. After a student gets accepted for an internship they must keep in contact with an academic advisor in the form of
   progress reports which can be then evaluated
10. After the internship ends the employer can then pay the students if an amount was initially agreed on
